*This soundpack had been renamed as we now support OpenTX and EdgeTX*

Real recorded voice files for use with OpenTX 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. and now EdgeTx 2.9

To download the current soundpack go to the
[Releases page](https://github.com/pinkywafer/OpenTX_soundpack-Joanne/releases).
Make sure to select the download that suits your firmware version.

The download also contains a contents.csv file listing the sounds and their filenames for reference.
Also included are the sounds for the Betaflight, INav, SXR and Yaapu Scripts

To install, extract the contents of the zip file and move the en\ folder into your SD Card's SOUNDS folder.

The binary files on Github are all stored in the `wav` folder.
The release download zip files are generated by the github release runner, which arranges the files based on the `contents.csv` and `scripts.csv` files

A separate download for each supported version of OpenTX is available from the releases page (above).

If you wish to request additional sounds to be added for your own use, from your model names, to flight modes etc
or if you have any issues with the pack, you can make reports / requests at either:

* or by [opening an issue on Github](https://github.com/pinkywafer/OpenTX_soundpack-Joanne/issues).
